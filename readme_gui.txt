Cppcheck GUI
============
This is a GUI for cppcheck. It allows selecting folder or set of files to check
with cppcheck and shows list of found errors.

Running
-------
You need Qt4 libraries installed in your system. Packages/files to install
depends on your operating system:
- Windows: download Qt4 from http://qt-project.org/downloads
- Linux: install Qt4 using your package manager, look for packages having Qt4
  in their name, e.g. for Ubuntu install libqt4-core and libqt4-gui.

Compiling
---------
Windows:
- The easy ways are:
-- download Qt SDK from http://qt-project.org/downloads and use
   QtCreator to build the GUI.
-- Download precompiled libraries for your platform and use your preferred
   IDE/environment to build GUI. Be careful to download the correct version of
   library for your compiler!
- The harder way is to download Qt sources and build Qt. Compiling Qt alone may
  take over 4 hours!

Linux:
- Install Qt development packages (make sure qmake -tool gets installed!). The
  names depend on distribution, but e.g. for Ubuntu the needed packages are:
  * libqt4-core
  * libqt4-gui
  * libqt4-dev
  * qt4-dev-tools
  * qt4-qmake

After you have needed libraries and tools installed, open command
prompt/console, go to gui directory and run command:
- qmake (in Linux and in Windows if build with MinGW/gcc or nmake)
- qmake -tp vc (to generate Visual Studio project file)
- qmake -tp vc LINKCORE=yes (to generate Visual Studio project file, linking
                             dynamically to core. Recommended.)

On Windows, you have to either call qtvars.bat in Qt folder or use the Qt command
line prompt shortcut added in the start menu by Qt installation.

These commands generate makefiles to actually build the software. After that
the actual building is done in IDE or command line as usual. Note that you
don't need to run qmake again unless you add/remove files from the project.

The Visual Studio solution does not contain a configuration for x64 platform, but
it can be added easily.

Tests
-----
There are tests for the GUI in gui/test -directory. There is test.pro
-projectfile for building all the tests. Each test is in own subdirectory and
builds own binary. Test is run by simple running that binary. The binary also
has several options to select tests etc. You can get the help by running
"binaryname -help" -command.

Translations
------------
The GUI is translated to several languages. Qt comes with two tools to update
and compile the translations. lupdate updates translations files from the code
and lrelease compiles translation files use with the executable.

To update translations:
- run lupdate gui.pro to update the translation files to match the code. This
  command updates all the .ts files. Which can be then edited to translate
  the application.

To compile translations:
- run lrelease gui.pro to compile .ts files to .qm files which are used by the
  executable.
