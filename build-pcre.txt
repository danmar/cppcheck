PCRE is a library that is used by the optional "rules" feature for the command
line version of cppcheck. It is readily available on Linux and Mac OS X, but
must be obtained separately for Windows.

If you're using qmake to generate makefiles, the following behavior applies:

- If you're not on Windows, it assumes by default that you have PCRE and want
  to enable rules support. You can disable rules support (removing the PCRE
  dependency) by passing HAVE_RULES=no to qmake.

- If you are on Windows, but have PCRE available, you can enable rules support
  by passing HAVE_RULES=yes to qmake.

  - Note: This includes using build.bat since it calls qmake - to use PCRE and
    build.bat, you need to run set HAVE_RULES=yes before each run of build.bat


Build instructions
------------------

Windows
-------

Visual Studio

To build PCRE, download the source code from www.pcre.org and
CMake (https://cmake.org/download/). We assume you use Visual Studio 2015 -
otherwise adapt the commands for your version.

VS Solution file
  cmake . -G "Visual Studio 14 2015"
  Open PCRE.sln with VS IDE or via cmd:
    call "%VS140COMNTOOLS%..\..\VC\vcvarsall.bat" x86
    MSBuild PCRE.sln /target:Build /property:Configuration="Release"

  For 64-bit target: cmake . -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64"

or using NMake
  call "%VS140COMNTOOLS%..\..\VC\vcvarsall.bat" x86
  cmake . -G "NMake Makefiles"
  nmake

or using MSYS
  cmake . -G "MSYS Makefiles"
  make


Linux
-----

The normal Makefile should work.

Install PCRE on Ubuntu might be needed:
  sudo apt-get install libpcre3 libpcre3-dev


Mac OSX
-------

Install PCRE:

homebre
  brew install pcre

or macport
  sudo port install pcre

Ensure /path/to/pcre.h is in CXXFLAGS, e.g:

for homebrew
  export CXXFLAGS=${CXXFLAGS}:/usr/local/include

or macport
  export CXXFLAGS=${CXXFLAGS}:/opt/local/include

Or for MSVC copy pcre.lib and pcre.h in /externals directory.
