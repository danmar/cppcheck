## About the name

The original name of this program was "C++check", but it was later changed to "Cppcheck".

Despite the name, Cppcheck is designed for both C and C++.

## Manual

A manual is available [online](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/manual.pdf).

## Compiling

Any C++11 compiler should work. For compilers with partial C++11 support it may work. If your compiler has the C++11 features that are available in Visual Studio 2010 then it will work. If nullptr is not supported by your compiler then this can be emulated using the header lib/cxx11emu.h.

To build the GUI, you need Qt.

When building the command line tool, [PCRE](http://www.pcre.org/) is optional. It is used if you build with rules.

There are multiple compilation choices:
* qmake - cross platform build tool
* Windows: Visual Studio (VS 2010 and above) or Qt Creator or MinGW
* gnu make
* g++ 4.4 (and above)
* clang++ 2.9 (and above)

### qmake

You can use the gui/gui.pro file to build the GUI.

```shell
cd gui
qmake
make
```

### Visual Studio

Use the cppcheck.sln file. The rules are normally enabled.

To compile with rules (PCRE dependency):
* the PCRE dll is needed. It can be downloaded from [here](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/pcre-8.10-vs.zip).

To compile without rules (no dependencies):
* remove the preprocessor define `HAVE_RULES` from the project
* remove the pcre.lib from the project

### Qt Creator + MinGW

The PCRE dll is needed to build the CLI. It can be downloaded here:
http://software-download.name/pcre-library-windows/

### GNU make

Simple build (no dependencies):

```shell
make
```

The recommended release build is:

```shell
make SRCDIR=build CFGDIR=cfg HAVE_RULES=yes
```

Flags:

1.  `SRCDIR=build`

    Python is used to optimise cppcheck

2.  `CFGDIR=cfg`

    Specify folder where .cfg files are found

3.  `HAVE_RULES=yes`

    Enable rules (PCRE is required if this is used)

### g++ (for experts)

If you just want to build Cppcheck without dependencies then you can use this command:

```shell
g++ -o cppcheck -std=c++0x -include lib/cxx11emu.h -Iexternals/tinyxml -Ilib cli/*.cpp lib/*.cpp externals/tinyxml/*.cpp
```

If you want to use `--rule` and `--rule-file` then dependencies are needed:

```shell
g++ -o cppcheck -std=c++0x -include lib/cxx11emu.h -lpcre -DHAVE_RULES -Ilib -Iexternals/tinyxml cli/*.cpp lib/*.cpp externals/tinyxml/*.cpp
```

### MinGW

```shell
make LDFLAGS=-lshlwapi
```

### Other Compiler/IDE

1. Create a empty project file / makefile.
2. Add all cpp files in the cppcheck cli and lib folders to the project file / makefile.
3. Compile.

### Cross compiling Win32 (CLI) version of Cppcheck in Linux

```shell
sudo apt-get install mingw32
make CXX=i586-mingw32msvc-g++ LDFLAGS="-lshlwapi" RDYNAMIC=""
mv cppcheck cppcheck.exe
```
