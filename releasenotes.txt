Deprecations:
- The "unix32-unsigned" and "unix64-unsigned" platforms have been deprecated and will be removed in Cppcheck 2.18. Please use "--platform=unix32 --funsigned-char" and "--platform=unix64 --funsigned-char" respectively instead.
- The "unspecified" platform has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version. It is also now identical to 'native' (i.e. char type signedness based on compiler instead of unknown).

Other:
- Removed deprecated support for builds via qmake.
- The `win32a` and `win32w` aliases have been added for the platforms `win32A` and `win32W` respectively.
- The possibility of an unknown signedness of the char type in a platform definition has been removed.
- The built-in "win*" and "unix*" platforms will now default to signed char type instead of unknown signedness. If you require unsigned chars please specify "--funsigned-char"
