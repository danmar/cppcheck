Release Notes for Cppcheck 2.12

New checks:
- uselessOverride finds overriding functions that either duplicate code from or delegate back to the base class implementation
- knownPointerToBool finds pointer to bool conversions that are always true or false

Improved checking:
- truncLongCastAssignment and truncLongCastReturn check additional types, including float/double/long double
- duplInheritedMember also reports duplicated member functions
- constParameter*/constVariable* checks find more instances of pointers/references that can be const, e.g. when calling library functions

GUI:
- Show in statistics which checkers have been activated in latest analysis
- Make it more visible if there has been critical errors that caused checkers to be skipped

Changed interface:
- Write how many checkers was activated after a run
- Added --checkers-report that can be used to generate a report in a file that shows what checkers was activated and disabled

Deprecations:
- The qmake build system has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
- Command-line option '--template <template>' is deprecated and will be removed in 2.13 - please use '--template=<template>' instead.
- Command-line option '--template-location <template>' is deprecated and will be removed in 2.13 - please use '--template-location=<template>' instead.

Other:
- "USE_QT6=On" will no longer fallback to Qt5 when Qt6 is not found.
- When the execution of an addon fails with an exitcode it will now result in an 'internalError' instead of being silently ignored.
- "Win32" configurations have been removed from the bundled Visual Studio solution and projects. You might still be able to build 32-bit binaries using CMake but that is untested and unmaintained.
