release notes for cppcheck-2.11

- The platform type 'Unspecified' within .cppcheck projects has been deprecated and will be removed in Cppcheck 2.14. Please use 'unspecified' instead.
- It is no longer necessary to run "--check-config" to get detailed "missingInclude" and "missingIncludeSystem" messages. They will always be issued in the regular analysis if "missingInclude" is enabled.
- "missingInclude" and "missingIncludeSystem" are reported with "-j" is > 1 and processes are used in the backend (default in non-Windows binaries)
- "missingInclude" and "missingIncludeSystem" will now cause the "--error-exitcode" to be applied
