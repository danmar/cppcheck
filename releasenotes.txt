Release Notes for Cppcheck 2.13

- returnImplicitInt for C functions without return type (previously reported as a debug message)

Improved checking:
-

GUI:
-

Changed interface:
-

Deprecations:
- "--showtime=top5" has been deprecated and will be removed in Cppcheck 2.14. Please use --showtime=top5_file or --showtime=top5_summary instead.
- Building with Qt5 has been deprecated (it went EOL in May 2023) and will be removed in a future version - please use Qt6 instead.

Other:
- Windows builds now default to the `native` platform instead of `win32A` or `win64`. Please specify it explicitly if you depend on it.
- The undocumented and deprecated command-line options `--template <template>` and `--template-format <template>` has been removed. Please use `--template=` and `--template-format=` instead.
- "--showtime=summary" will now show a single summary at the end instead of showing it after each file when using the thread execution (default on Windows)
- added "--showtime=none" to disable any previously specified showtime report. "--showtime=" without parameter is no longer valid.
- Multiple "--project" options are now prohibited. These would have overlapped each other and lead to unexpected behavior. Please use separate runs with a single "--project" option instead.
- "--project" can also no longer be used in conjunction with additional source files.
- If a addon cannot be found it will bail out immediately instead of continously writing errors and failing the analysis at the end.
- Added CMake option "BUILD_MANPAGE" which adds the "man" target which will build the manpage. This requires xsltproc and the docbook XSLs to be installed.
- Improved inline suppressions:
  - You can suppress warnings in a block of code using "-begin" and "-end".
  - You can suppress warnings in current file using "-file".
  - You can suppress all warnings where macro is used using "-macro"
- fixed CMake build with UBSAN and GCC
- Added command-line options "--fsigned-char" and "--funsigned-char" to control the signess of the "char" type. This overrides previously specified "--platform" options and is overrides by following ones.
