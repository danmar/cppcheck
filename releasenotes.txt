Release Notes for Cppcheck 2.19

New checks:
- Detect zero initialization of unions in which its largest member is not
  declared as the first one. Depending on the compiler, there's no guarantee
  that the complete union will be zero initialized in such scenarios leading to
  potential access of uninitialized memory.
