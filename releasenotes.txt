Release Notes for Cppcheck 2.17

New checks:
- staticFunction: detect functions that should have internal linkage since they
  are not used outside of their translation unit.
- Check null pointer return from memory/resource allocation functions (nullPointerOutOfMemory, nullPointerArithmeticOutOfMemory, nullPointerOutOfResources, ctunullpointerOutOfMemory, ctunullpointerOutOfResources).

Improved checking:
-

GUI:
-

Changed interface:
-Added `reduced` check level. It can be activated with `--check-level=reduced`. You get faster analysis
but some fewer results. The motivation is to be able to make analysis time "acceptable" for direct usage.

-Added `--report-type` option. Enables printing of guidelines and classifications for several coding
standards in place of the regular error identifiers and severities.

Deprecations:
-

Other:
- Removed deperecated support for builds via qmake.
