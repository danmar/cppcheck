## Description

Cppcheck has found code that is confusing and does not know how to analyze it. Analysis is aborted.

Your code is probably OK but you need to configure Cppcheck to understand the code better.

## How to fix

Review the configuration.

If Cppcheck warns about a macro that is defined in a 3rd party library, and there is a cfg file for that, then a `--library=` option may be a proper solution.

If Cppcheck warns about a macro that is defined in a header that should included, make sure that this header is included properly. Cppcheck must have the include path.

If Cppcheck warns about a compiler keyword add a `-D` that defines this keyword somehow. I.e. if cppcheck should just ignore the keyword then
an `-DKEYWORD=` option is suggested.

## Example

### Example code 1
```
    fprintf(stderr, "Generating up to " F_U64 " sequences and up to " F_U64 " bases.\n", nSeqs, nBases);
```

Warning:

canu-2.2/src/seqrequester/src/seqrequester/generate.H:72:41: error: There is an unknown macro here somewhere. Configuration is required. If F_U64 is a macro then please configure it. [unknownMacro]

Fix:

Somehow `F_U64` must be specified for Cppcheck to be able to analyse this properly. Either:
 * Add `-DF_U64="x"` to explicitly tell Cppcheck what it should replace F_U64 with. Or;
 * Add `-I..` so that headers are included properly.
 * If the symbol is defined in a 3rd party library adding a corresponding `--library=` might solve such issue.

### Example code 2
```
BOTAN_FUNC_ISA("crypto")
void AES_128::hw_aes_encrypt_n(const uint8_t in[], uint8_t out[], size_t blocks) const
```

Warning:

botan-2.19.5+dfsg/src/lib/block/aes/aes_power8/aes_power8.cpp:103:1: error: There is an unknown macro here somewhere. Configuration is required. If BOTAN_FUNC_ISA is a macro then please configure it. [unknownMacro]

Fix:

Somehow `BOTAN_FUNC_ISA` must be specified for Cppcheck to be able to analyse this properly. Either:
 * Add `-DBOTAN_FUNC_ISA(X)=` to explicitly tell Cppcheck that BOTAN_FUNC_ISA("crypto") should be ignored. Or;
 * Add `-I..` so that headers are included properly.
 * If the symbol is defined in a 3rd party library adding a corresponding `--library=` might solve such issue.
