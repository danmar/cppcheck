<h1>Project File Dialog</h1>

<p>The <i>Project file</i> dialog contains 4 tabs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paths and defines; paths to check and basic preprocessor settings.
<li>Types and Functions; configuration of platform and 3rd party libraries
<li>Analysis; analysis options
<li>Warning options; formatting warnings, suppressing warnings, etc
<li>Addons; extra analysis with addons
</ul>

<h2>Paths and defines</h2>

<p>It is recommended to import a project file.</p>

<h3> Import project</h3>

Project to import. Cppcheck will get:
<ul>
<li>What files to check
<li>Preprocessor defines
<li>Preprocessor include paths
<li>Language standard if set
</ul>

<h3>Paths (If you do not import project)</h3>

<p>What paths to check.</p>

<h3>Defines (If you do not import project)</h3>

<p>Cppcheck automatically checks the code with different preprocessor
configurations.</p>

<blockquote><pre>#ifdef A
code1
#endif
#ifdef B
code2
#endif</pre></blockquote>

<p>Cppcheck will automatically perform analysis both when A is defined and B is
defined. So any bugs in both code1 and code2 will be detected.</p>

<p>If you want to configure that A will always be defined in Cppcheck analysis
you can do that here.</p>

<p>Defines are separated by semicolon. So you can for instance write:</p>

<blockquote><pre>A;B=3;C</pre></blockquote>

<h3>Undefines (If you do not import project)</h3>

<p>Cppcheck automatically checks the code with different preprocessor
configurations.</p>

<blockquote><pre>#ifdef A
code1
#endif
#ifdef B
code2
#endif</pre></blockquote>

<p>Cppcheck will automatically perform analysis both when A is defined and B is
defined. So any bugs in both code1 and code2 will be detected.</p>

<p>If you want to configure that A is never defined in Cppcheck analysis you
can do that here.</p>

<p>Undefines are separated by semicolon. So you can for instance write:</p>

<blockquote><pre>A;C</pre></blockquote>

<h3>Include paths (If you do not import project)</h3>

<p>Specify include paths.</p>

<h2>Types and Functions</h2>

<p>Cppcheck uses the <i>Platform</i> setting to determine size of
short/int/long/pointer/etc.</p>

<p>Check the libraries that you use in the <i>Libraries</i> listbox.</p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<h3>Cppcheck build dir</h3>

<p>This is a work-folder that Cppcheck uses. Each Cppcheck project should have
a separate build dir. It is used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>whole program analysis
<li>debug output
<li>faster analysis (if a source file has changed check it, if source file is
   not changed then reuse old results)
<li>statistics
</ul>

<h3>Parser</h3>

<p>It is in general recommended to use Cppcheck parser. However you can choose
to use Clang parser; Clang will be executed with a command line flag that tells
it to dump its AST and Cppcheck will read that AST and convert it into a
corresponding Cppcheck AST and use that.</p>

<h3>Analysis</h3>

<p>Configure what kind of analysis you want.</p>

<p>The <i>Normal analysis</i> is recommended for most use cases. Especially if
you use Cppcheck in CI.</p>

<p>The <i>Bug hunting</i> can be used if you really want to find a bug in your
code and can invest time looking at bad results and providing extra
configuration.</p>

<h3>Limit analysis</h3>

<p>You can turn off checking of headers. That could be interesting if Cppcheck
is very slow. But normally, you should check the code in headers.</p>

<p>It is possible to check the code in unused templates. However the Cppcheck
AST will be incomplete/wrong. The recommendation is that you do not check
unused templates to avoid wrong warnings. The templates will be checked
properly when you do use them.</p>

<p>Max CTU depth: How deep should the whole program analysis be. The risk with
a &quot;too high&quot; value is that Cppcheck will be slow.</p>

<p>Max recursion in template instantiation: Max recursion when Cppcheck
instantiates templates. The risk with a &quot;too high&quot; value is that
Cppcheck will be slow and can require much memory.</p>


<h2>Warning options</h2>

<h3>Root path</h3>

<p>The root path for warnings. Cppcheck will strip away this part of the path
from warnings. For instance if there is a warning in
<pre>../myproject/foo/bar/file.cpp</pre> and the root path is 
<pre>../myproject/foo</pre> then the path for the warning will be
<pre>bar/file.cpp</pre>.</p>

<h3>Warning Tags</h3>

<p>Tags allow you to manually categorize warnings.</p>

<h3>Exclude source files</h3>

<p>Excluded source files will not be analyzed by Cppcheck.</p>

<h3>Suppressions</h3>

<p>List of suppressions. These warnings will not be shown.</p>

<h2>Addons</h2>

<p><b>Y2038</b><br>32-bit timers that count number of seconds since 1970 will
overflow in year 2038. Check that the code does not use such timers.</p>

<p><b>Thread safety</b><br>Check that the code is thread safe</p>

<p><b>MISRA</b><br>Ensure that the MISRA coding standard is followed. Please
note you need to have a textfile with the misra rule texts to get proper
warning messages. Cppcheck is not legally allowed to distribute the misra
rule texts.</p>

<p><b>Clang-tidy</b><br>Run Clang-tidy</p>
