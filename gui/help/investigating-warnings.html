<h1>Investigating warnings</h1>

<p>When you have run the analysis it is time to look at the results.</p>

<p>If you click on a warning then the corresponding code will be shown in the
&quot;Warning details&quot; at the bottom.</p>

<p>You can right click warnings to get options. The difference of
&quot;hiding&quot; a warning and &quot;suppressing&quot; a warning is that
the suppression is permanent and hiding the warning is only temporary. When
suppressing warning(s), that is saved in the project file.
