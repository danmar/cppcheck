<h1>Preferences</h1>

<p><b>Number of threads</b><br>Number of threads to use in analysis. Each
thread checks its own source file.</p>

<p><b>Force checking of all #ifdef configurations</b><br>Cppcheck try to check
all code and will therefore guess different preprocessor configurations. The
maximum number of configurations that is checked is 14 by default.</p>

<p><b>Show full path of files</b><br>Show the full paths in the results.</p>

<p><b>Show &quot;No errors found&quot; message when no errors found</b><br>
If you want to get a message box about this.</p>

<p><b>Display error id column &quot;Id&quot;</b><br>Show error id in results</p>

<p><b>Enable inline suppressions</b><br>You can suppress warnings with comments.
See the Cppcheck manual (https://cppcheck.sourceforge.io/manual.pdf) for more
information about inline suppressions.</p>

<p><b>Check for inconclusive errors also</b><br>When full analysis of the code
can not determine if there should be a warning or not, it is inconclusive.
Normally Cppcheck does not warn then.</p>

<p><b>Show statistics on check completion</b><br>Show statistics in a window
when analysis finish.</p>

<p><b>Show internal warnings in log</b><br>Internal warnings (for debugging) is
shown in the <i>Analysis log</i>.</p>

<p><b>Applications</b><br>Configure external editor to open from context menu
when you right click on a warning.</p>

<p><b>Save all errors when creating report</b><br>If hidden warnings should be
saved or not.</p>

<p><b>Save full path to files in report</b><br>If you use <i>Root path</i> the
warnings on the screen will not have the full path.</p>

<p><b>Language</b><br>Configure language to use for GUI.</p>

<p><b>Python binary</b><br>To be able to execute addons, Cppcheck needs to know
where python is. Unless you configure something, Cppcheck will try to execute
python in your PATH.</p>

<p><b>MISRA rule texts</b><br>Only needed if you want to use the MISRA addon.
Cppcheck is not legally allowed to distribute the MISRA rule texts and these
must be provided by users. The MISRA rule texts are proprietary. An example
rule text file:
<blockquote><pre>Appendix A Summary of guidelines
Rule 1.1
Text of rule 1.1
Rule 1.2
Text of rule 1.2</pre></blockquote>
</p>

<p><b>Clang path</b><br>The path to <i>clang</i> binary. If no path is provided
then system PATH is used.</p>

<p><b>Visual studio headers</b><br>If you want to use the Visual Studio headers
in the analysis you can provide the path(s) here. Hint: Open a visual studio
command prompt and type <i>SET INCLUDE</i>. Then copy/paste the paths.</p>

<p><b>Code editor style</b><br>The visual theme to use for the code editor that
is used when you investigate results.</p>
