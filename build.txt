
Some temporary build instructions. This is work in progress.


Windows

Visual Studio

To build pcre I downloaded the sourcecode from www.pcre.org. I downloaded cmake 2.8.
Then I built the lib with:
    cmake .
    nmake

The resulting files can be downloaded here (please try if it works):
    http://cppcheck.sf.net/pcre-8.10-vs.zip


MINGW (Qt 4.7 SDK)

I downloaded pcre-8.0-lib.zip from here: http://software-download.name/pcre-library-windows/


Linux

The normal Makefile should work

Install pcre on ubuntu might be needed:
sudo apt-get install libpcre3 libpcre3-dev
